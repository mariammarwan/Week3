# Form, iFrame, and ARIA
After spending some time searching and watching new tutorials about HTML i have found a lot of interesting tags that will be so helpfull, for example the form tag which helps me to make a form that can collect the user's data easily turned out to have a lot of features like the radio, checkbox, select, and textarea attributes and tags. I have also learned how to make a live web page inside the one i'm using while controling its dimensions using the width attribute! And lastly i was able to design a table while including many details in it using a lot of tags like the <th> and <td> tags! Hoping to keep exploring the varieties of the HTML tags and attributes :)
